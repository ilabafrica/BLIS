#OVERWRITEFILE sets whether the export handler would overwrite an existing file 
#the newly created exported file. If it is set to false the export handler would
#not overwrite. In this case if INTELLIGENTFILENAMING is set to true the handler
#would add a suffix to the new file name. The suffix is a randomly generated UUID.
#Additionally, you can add a timestamp or random number as additional prefix.
